    "ingredients": "1 cup unsalted butter, softened\n3/4 cup granulated sugar\n1/4 cup light brown sugar, packed\n1 large egg, room temperature\n1/2 teaspoon pure almond extract\n1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract\n2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour\n2 teaspoons ground cinnamon\n1/2 teaspoon baking soda\n1/4 teaspoon salt\n1 cup almonds, finely chopped\n3 tablespoons cinnamon sugar (2 1/2 tablespoons sugar mixed with 1/2 tablespoon cinnamon), for rolling",
    "method": "Step 1: Start by getting your oven nice and hot at 350°F (175°C). While that's heating up, grab two baking sheets and line them with parchment paper or silicone mats to prevent sticking – trust me, this little step saves so much hassle later!\n\nStep 2: In a large mixing bowl, cream together your softened butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar. Don't rush this bit – beat them together for about 3-4 minutes until the mixture becomes really light and fluffy. This creates air pockets that'll give your cookies that gorgeous texture.\n\nStep 3: Crack in your egg and pour in both the almond and vanilla extracts. Beat again until everything's beautifully combined and looks smooth and glossy, about 1 minute. Scrape down the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula to make sure everything's mixed evenly.\n\nStep 4: In a separate bowl, whisk together your flour, cinnamon, baking soda, and salt. This helps distribute all those dry ingredients evenly before they hit your wet mixture.\n\nStep 5: Gradually add your dry ingredients to the butter mixture, mixing on low speed just until combined – about 30 seconds. Over-mixing will make your cookies tough, so go easy here!\n\nStep 6: Fold in your chopped almonds with a wooden spoon or spatula until they're evenly distributed throughout the dough. If the almonds are too large, they'll make the cookies fall apart, so make sure they're finely chopped.\n\nStep 7: In a small bowl, mix together your cinnamon sugar topping. Scoop out tablespoon-sized portions of dough (about 1-inch balls), roll them between your palms to form perfect little spheres, then roll each ball in the cinnamon sugar mixture until completely coated.\n\nStep 8: Place the coated dough balls on your prepared baking sheets, spacing them about 2 inches apart as they'll spread while baking. Gently flatten each ball slightly with the bottom of a glass or your palm.\n\nStep 9: Bake in your preheated oven for 10-12 minutes, until the edges are set and just beginning to turn golden brown. The centers may look slightly underdone – that's perfect! They'll continue cooking a bit as they cool and stay wonderfully chewy.\n\nStep 10: Let the cookies cool on the baking sheets for 5 minutes – they're quite delicate when hot. Then transfer them to wire racks to cool completely. As they cool, they'll develop that perfect balance of crisp edges and tender centers with the beautiful flavor of almonds and warm cinnamon.",
    "faqs": "<h3 id=\"\">What ingredients are used in Almond &amp; Cinnamon Cookies?</h3><p id=\"\">These cookies require unsalted butter, granulated and brown sugars, egg, almond and vanilla extracts, flour, cinnamon, baking soda, salt, chopped almonds, and a cinnamon sugar coating. The balance of warm spices with nutty almonds creates their distinctive flavour profile.</p><h3 id=\"\">How to bake Almond &amp; Cinnamon Cookies at home?</h3><p id=\"\">Learn how to bake Almond &amp; Cinnamon Cookies by preheating your oven to 350°F, creaming butter with sugars until fluffy, adding egg and extracts, mixing in dry ingredients, folding in chopped almonds, rolling dough balls in cinnamon sugar, and baking for 10-12 minutes until edges are golden but centres remain slightly soft for that perfect chewy texture.</p><h3 id=\"\">Why should I chill cookie dough before baking?</h3><p id=\"\">Chilling cookie dough allows fats to solidify, preventing excessive spreading during baking. It also deepens flavours as ingredients meld together and enhances the chewy texture. For these cinnamon almond cookies, 30 minutes in the fridge will improve their texture and flavour complexity.</p><h3 id=\"\">Can I make these cookies without almond extract?</h3><p id=\"\">Yes, you can omit almond extract or substitute with additional vanilla extract, though you'll lose some of the distinctive almond flavour. Another option is using a small amount of amaretto liqueur or a drop of bitter almond oil for a similar aromatic quality.</p><h3 id=\"\">How long do homemade cookies stay fresh?</h3><p id=\"\">These homemade cookies will stay fresh for up to 5 days when stored in an airtight container at room temperature. For longer storage, freeze baked cookies for up to 3 months. Adding a slice of bread to your storage container helps maintain moisture and prevent them from drying out.</p>",
