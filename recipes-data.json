    "ingredients": "1 cup unsalted butter, softened\n3/4 cup granulated sugar\n1/4 cup light brown sugar, packed\n1 large egg, room temperature\n1/2 teaspoon pure almond extract\n1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract\n2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour\n2 teaspoons ground cinnamon\n1/2 teaspoon baking soda\n1/4 teaspoon salt\n1 cup almonds, finely chopped\n3 tablespoons cinnamon sugar (2 1/2 tablespoons sugar mixed with 1/2 tablespoon cinnamon), for rolling",
    "method": "Step 1: Start by getting your oven nice and hot at 350°F (175°C). While that's heating up, grab two baking sheets and line them with parchment paper or silicone mats to prevent sticking – trust me, this little step saves so much hassle later!\n\nStep 2: In a large mixing bowl, cream together your softened butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar. Don't rush this bit – beat them together for about 3-4 minutes until the mixture becomes really light and fluffy. This creates air pockets that'll give your cookies that gorgeous texture.\n\nStep 3: Crack in your egg and pour in both the almond and vanilla extracts. Beat again until everything's beautifully combined and looks smooth and glossy, about 1 minute. Scrape down the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula to make sure everything's mixed evenly.\n\nStep 4: In a separate bowl, whisk together your flour, cinnamon, baking soda, and salt. This helps distribute all those dry ingredients evenly before they hit your wet mixture.\n\nStep 5: Gradually add your dry ingredients to the butter mixture, mixing on low speed just until combined – about 30 seconds. Over-mixing will make your cookies tough, so go easy here!\n\nStep 6: Fold in your chopped almonds with a wooden spoon or spatula until they're evenly distributed throughout the dough. If the almonds are too large, they'll make the cookies fall apart, so make sure they're finely chopped.\n\nStep 7: In a small bowl, mix together your cinnamon sugar topping. Scoop out tablespoon-sized portions of dough (about 1-inch balls), roll them between your palms to form perfect little spheres, then roll each ball in the cinnamon sugar mixture until completely coated.\n\nStep 8: Place the coated dough balls on your prepared baking sheets, spacing them about 2 inches apart as they'll spread while baking. Gently flatten each ball slightly with the bottom of a glass or your palm.\n\nStep 9: Bake in your preheated oven for 10-12 minutes, until the edges are set and just beginning to turn golden brown. The centers may look slightly underdone – that's perfect! They'll continue cooking a bit as they cool and stay wonderfully chewy.\n\nStep 10: Let the cookies cool on the baking sheets for 5 minutes – they're quite delicate when hot. Then transfer them to wire racks to cool completely. As they cool, they'll develop that perfect balance of crisp edges and tender centers with the beautiful flavor of almonds and warm cinnamon.",
    "faqs": "<h3 id=\"\">What ingredients are used in Almond &amp; Cinnamon Cookies?</h3><p id=\"\">These cookies require unsalted butter, granulated and brown sugars, egg, almond and vanilla extracts, flour, cinnamon, baking soda, salt, chopped almonds, and a cinnamon sugar coating.

    "method": "Step 1: Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line two baking sheets with parchment paper. This prevents sticking and makes cleanup a breeze, trust me! Step 2: In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, salt, and ground anise seeds until well combined. If you're using anise extract instead of ground seeds, you'll add that with the wet ingredients later. Step 3: In a large bowl, cream the softened butter and 3/4 cup sugar together using an electric mixer on medium speed. Keep going for about 3 minutes until the mixture becomes pale and fluffy – this creates air pockets that help your cookies get that lovely texture. Step 4: Add the egg and beat until fully incorporated, about 1 minute. Then mix in the vanilla extract, almond extract, and anise extract (if using instead of ground seeds). Scrape down the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula to make sure everything's evenly mixed. Step 5: Gradually add the flour mixture to the wet ingredients on low speed, mixing just until combined. Over-mixing will develop the gluten and make your cookies tough, so take it easy here! Step 6: Gently fold in the toasted, cooled sliced almonds with a spatula until evenly distributed throughout the dough. The dough will be somewhat soft but should hold together well. Step 7: Place the remaining 1/4 cup sugar in a small bowl. Scoop the dough using a tablespoon measure or a small cookie scoop (about 1-inch balls), then roll each portion between your palms to form a smooth ball. Step 8: Roll each ball in the sugar until completely coated, then place on the prepared baking sheets about 2 inches apart – they'll spread a bit as they bake. Step 9: Bake in the preheated oven for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are just set and turning golden brown, while the centers still look slightly soft. The cookies will continue to firm up as they cool, so don't overbake them! Step 10: Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheets for 5 minutes, then transfer to wire racks to cool completely. As they cool, they'll develop that perfect texture: crisp around the edges with slightly chewy centers. Step 11: Store cooled cookies in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 5 days, or freeze for up to 3 months.

    "method": "Step 1: Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line two baking sheets with parchment paper. This recipe makes about two dozen cookies, so you'll likely need to bake in batches. Step 2: Toast hazelnuts by spreading them on a baking sheet and placing in the preheated oven for 8-10 minutes, until fragrant and skins begin to crack. Tip them onto a clean kitchen towel, fold the towel over and rub vigorously to remove most of the skins. Don't worry if some skin remains. Let cool completely, then roughly chop and set aside. Step 3: In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar using an electric mixer on medium speed. Beat for about 3-4 minutes until the mixture becomes light and fluffy – don't rush this step, it's crucial for a good cookie texture! Step 4: Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Mix in the vanilla extract and coffee liqueur (if using), scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed to ensure everything is well incorporated. Step 5: In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, instant espresso powder, baking soda, and salt. Gradually add this dry mixture to the wet ingredients, mixing on low speed until just combined. Be careful not to overmix – stop as soon as the flour disappears. Step 6: Gently fold in the chopped hazelnuts and caramel pieces using a rubber spatula. The dough will be quite thick and studded with delicious bits of goodness. Step 7: Chill the dough for at least 30 minutes (or up to 24 hours) in the refrigerator. This resting time allows the flavors to meld and prevents the cookies from spreading too much during baking. Step 8: Using a cookie scoop or tablespoon, portion the dough into balls about 1 1/2 tablespoons each. Place them on the prepared baking sheets, spacing them about 2 inches apart as they will spread during baking. Step 9: Bake in the preheated oven for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown but the centers still look slightly soft. The caramel will be bubbling hot, so be careful! For even baking, rotate the sheets halfway through the baking time. Step 10: Remove from oven and let the cookies cool on the baking sheets for 5 minutes – they'll be too soft to move immediately. During this time, you can gently press any escaped caramel back towards the cookies using a butter knife. Step 11: Transfer cookies to a wire rack to cool completely. They'll firm up as they cool, leaving you with chewy centers and crisp edges. Store in an airtight container for up to 5 days, with parchment paper between layers to prevent sticking due to the caramel pieces.",

    "ingredients": "2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour\n1 teaspoon baking soda\n1 teaspoon salt\n1 cup unsalted butter, softened\n3/4 cup granulated sugar\n3/4 cup packed brown sugar\n2 large eggs, room temperature\n2 teaspoons vanilla extract\n2 cups semi-sweet chocolate chips\n1-2 teaspoons chili powder (adjust to taste)\n1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional, for extra heat)\n1/4 cup crystallized ginger, finely chopped (optional)\nFlaky sea salt for sprinkling (optional)",
    "method": "Step 1: Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Line two baking sheets with parchment paper and set aside. This prevents the cookies from sticking and makes cleanup a breeze.\n\nStep 2: In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, salt, chili powder, and cayenne pepper (if using). The cayenne adds extra heat, so if you're sensitive to spice, start with just the chili powder. Mix thoroughly to ensure the spices are evenly distributed.\n\nStep 3: In a large bowl, beat the softened butter until creamy, about 1 minute. Add both the granulated and brown sugars and continue beating until the mixture becomes light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Don't rush this step – it's crucial for creating that perfect cookie texture!\n\nStep 4: Add the eggs one at a time to the butter-sugar mixture, beating well after each addition. Then mix in the vanilla extract. The mixture should look smooth and well incorporated.\n\nStep 5: Gradually add the flour mixture to the wet ingredients, mixing on low speed just until combined. Over-mixing will develop the gluten and make your cookies tough, so stop as soon as no dry flour is visible.\n\nStep 6: Fold in the chocolate chips and crystallized ginger (if using) with a rubber spatula until evenly distributed throughout the dough. The ginger adds a lovely complementary heat that's different from the chili.\n\nStep 7: For best results, chill the dough for at least 30 minutes (or up to 24 hours). This allows the flavors to meld and prevents the cookies from spreading too much during baking.\n\nStep 8: Using a cookie scoop or tablespoon, drop rounded balls of dough onto the prepared baking sheets, spacing them about 2 inches apart. These cookies will spread while baking.\n\nStep 9: If desired, sprinkle a small amount of flaky sea salt on top of each dough ball. This enhances both the sweetness and the spice.\n\nStep 10: Bake in the preheated oven for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown but the centers still look slightly underdone. The cookies will continue to cook on the hot baking sheet after removal from the oven.\n\nStep 11: Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheets for 5 minutes, then transfer to wire racks to cool completely. As they cool, the cookies will firm up while maintaining a chewy center.\n\nStep 12: Store in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 5 days, or freeze for up to 3 months.

    "method": "Step 1: Prepare your workspace by lining a small baking sheet or 8x8-inch pan with parchment paper, making sure the paper extends up the sides for easy removal later. Finely chop the rosemary leaves until they're almost a paste-like consistency - this helps release the essential oils and flavor. Step 2: Create a double boiler by placing a heat-proof bowl over a pot of barely simmering water (make sure the bottom of the bowl doesn't touch the water). Add the chopped dark chocolate and butter to the bowl. Stir occasionally with a silicone spatula until completely melted and smooth, about 3-4 minutes. Be patient here, mate - rushing can make your chocolate grainy! Step 3: Once the chocolate mixture is perfectly smooth, remove from heat and immediately stir in the chopped rosemary, honey, and vanilla extract. The residual heat will help infuse the rosemary flavor into the chocolate. Keep stirring for about 1 minute to make sure everything is beautifully combined. Step 4: Pour the chocolate mixture onto your prepared parchment paper, using your spatula to spread it evenly to about 1/4-inch thickness. Give the pan a gentle shake to level out the surface. While the chocolate is still wet, sprinkle the sea salt evenly across the top, and if you're feeling fancy, press a few small rosemary leaves or tiny sprigs into the surface as decoration. Step 5: Let the chocolate set at room temperature for about 30 minutes, then transfer to the refrigerator to fully firm up, at least 1 hour. Don't rush this step - proper setting time ensures clean cuts and perfect texture. Step 6: Once completely set, remove the chocolate from the pan using the parchment paper. With a sharp knife, cut into squares, rectangles, or triangles - whatever shape takes your fancy! For the cleanest cuts, warm your knife blade under hot water and wipe dry between cuts. Step 7: Store your dark chocolate with rosemary in an airtight container, with pieces separated by parchment paper to prevent sticking. Keep in a cool, dry place for up to 1 week, or in the refrigerator for up to 3 weeks. Just let them come to room temperature before serving to fully appreciate the complex flavors!",

    "ingredients": "1 cup unsalted butter, softened\n1 cup light brown sugar, packed\n1/2 cup granulated sugar\n2 large eggs, room temperature\n2 teaspoons vanilla extract\n1/2 cup hazelnut spread (like Nutella)\n2 3/4 cups all-purpose flour\n1 teaspoon baking soda\n1/2 teaspoon baking powder\n1/2 teaspoon salt\n1 cup white chocolate chips\n1 cup milk chocolate chips\n8 Kinder Bueno bars (4 twin packs), roughly chopped\n1/4 cup chopped hazelnuts (optional)\nFlaky sea salt for sprinkling (optional)",
    "method": "Step 1: Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line two large baking sheets with parchment paper. This prevents sticking and makes cleanup a breeze, my friends.\n\nStep 2: In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter, brown sugar, and granulated sugar using an electric mixer on medium speed. Keep going for about 3-4 minutes until the mixture becomes light and fluffy – don't rush this step, it creates that perfect cookie texture!\n\nStep 3: Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition until fully incorporated. Then mix in the vanilla extract and hazelnut spread until smooth and creamy, about 1 minute more. Scrape down the sides of the bowl as needed to ensure everything's evenly mixed.\n\nStep 4: In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt. Gradually add this dry mixture to the wet ingredients, mixing on low speed just until combined. Over-mixing will make your cookies tough, so stop once you see the flour disappear.\n\nStep 5: Using a wooden spoon or spatula, gently fold in the white chocolate chips, milk chocolate chips, and about 3/4 of the chopped Kinder Bueno pieces (save the rest for topping). If using hazelnuts, add them now too. The mixture will be quite thick and chunky – that's exactly what we want!\n\nStep 6: Use an ice cream scoop or 1/4 cup measure to portion the dough into balls, placing them about 3 inches apart on the prepared baking sheets. These cookies will spread, so give them room! Slightly flatten each ball with your palm.\n\nStep 7: Press the remaining Kinder Bueno pieces into the tops of each cookie dough ball. This ensures those beautiful chunks are visible on top and creates those irresistible pockets of hazelnut chocolate and wafer.\n\nStep 8: Bake in the preheated oven for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are set and lightly golden but the centers still look slightly underdone. They'll continue cooking on the hot tray, giving you that perfect chewy center. For crispier cookies, bake for 2-3 minutes longer.\n\nStep 9: Remove from the oven and immediately sprinkle with a little flaky sea salt if using – this really elevates the flavors! Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheets for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.\n\nStep 10: Store any leftover cookies in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 5 days, or freeze the baked cookies for up to 3 months. You can also freeze the dough balls and bake them straight from frozen (just add 2 extra minutes to the baking time) whenever you need a fresh Kinder Bueno cookie fix!",

    "prepTime": "15 mins",

    "ingredients": "1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, softened\n2/3 cup granulated sugar\n2 tablespoons fresh lemon zest (from about 2 medium lemons)\n1 tablespoon dried culinary lavender buds\n1/4 teaspoon salt\n2 cups all-purpose flour\n1 teaspoon vanilla extract\n1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice\n2 tablespoons coarse sugar for sprinkling (optional)",
    "method": "Step 1: Before you begin, make sure your butter is properly softened to room temperature - it should yield to gentle pressure but still hold its shape. In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter and granulated sugar until light and fluffy, about 3-4 minutes. Don't rush this step - proper creaming creates that perfect shortbread texture.\n\nStep 2: Add the lemon zest, making sure you're only grating the yellow part of the lemon (the white pith is bitter). Then add the dried culinary lavender buds. If your lavender buds are particularly large, you can gently crush them between your fingers first to release more flavor. Mix until well incorporated, about 30 seconds.\n\nStep 3: Add the vanilla extract and fresh lemon juice to the butter mixture, stirring until well combined. The mixture might look slightly curdled, but don't worry - that's perfectly normal!\n\nStep 4: In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour and salt. Gradually add this dry mixture to your butter mixture, about 1/2 cup at a time, mixing on low speed just until combined. Be careful not to overmix - stop as soon as no dry flour remains. The dough should be soft but not sticky.\n\nStep 5: Divide the dough in half and shape each half into a log about 1.5 inches in diameter. Wrap each log tightly in parchment paper or plastic wrap, twisting the ends to secure. Refrigerate for at least 2 hours, or preferably overnight. This chilling time is crucial for developing flavor and ensuring your cookies hold their shape.\n\nStep 6: When ready to bake, preheat your oven to 325°F (165°C) and line two baking sheets with parchment paper. Remove one log from the refrigerator and let it sit for about 5 minutes to slightly soften (just enough to prevent cracking when slicing).\n\nStep 7: Using a sharp knife, slice the log into rounds about 1/4 inch thick. Place the cookies on the prepared baking sheets, leaving about 1 inch between each cookie. If desired, sprinkle the tops with coarse sugar for a little extra crunch and sparkle.\n\nStep 8: Bake in the preheated oven for 11-13 minutes, or until the edges are just barely beginning to turn golden. Don't overbake! The cookies should not brown significantly - they'll be pale with just a hint of color at the edges.\n\nStep 9: Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely. They will be very delicate when hot but will firm up as they cool. Repeat with the remaining dough log. Store in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 1 week, or freeze for up to 3 months.",

Once they're rehydrated, drain them thoroughly, gently squeeze out any excess moisture, and finely chop them until you have about 2 tablespoons worth. Set these aside to cool completely.\n\nStep 2: In a large mixing bowl, beat the softened butter and sugar together using an electric mixer on medium speed. You want to get it lovely and creamy, about 3 minutes until it's pale and fluffy. This incorporates air into the mixture, which will give your cookies a beautiful texture.\n\nStep 3: Add in your finely chopped mousserons, walnuts, fresh thyme leaves, garlic powder, sea salt, and black pepper. Mix everything together until thoroughly combined. The mixture will smell wonderfully earthy and aromatic!\n\nStep 4: Gradually add the flour to your butter mixture, mixing on low speed until just incorporated. Be careful not to overmix, love - you want to stop as soon as there are no visible streaks of flour. The dough will be somewhat crumbly but should hold together when pressed.\n\nStep 5: Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and gently knead it a few times until it comes together. Shape it into a log about 2 inches in diameter. Wrap the log tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, or even better, overnight. This resting time allows the flavors to meld together beautifully.\n\nStep 6: When you're ready to bake, preheat your oven to 325°F (165°C) and line two baking sheets with parchment paper. Take your dough log out of the fridge and let it sit at room temperature for about 10 minutes to make it easier to slice.\n\nStep 7: In a small bowl, whisk together the egg yolk and cold water to create an egg wash. Slice the dough log into rounds about 1/4 inch thick and place them on the prepared baking sheets, leaving about an inch between each cookie.\n\nStep 8: Lightly brush the top of each cookie with the egg wash and sprinkle with a tiny pinch of sea salt. This will give them a beautiful golden color and enhance the savory flavors.\n\nStep 9: Bake in the preheated oven for 13-15 minutes, or until the edges are just turning golden brown. Keep a close eye on them as they can go from perfectly golden to overdone quite quickly.\n\nStep 10: Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheets for 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.

The perfect balance of sweet and savory, these cookies feature bright orange zest and earthy green olives for an unforgettable flavor combination that's sure to impress at your next gathering.",
    "prepTime": "20 mins",
    "cookTime": "15 mins",
    "servings": "24",
    "calories": "175",
    "ingredients": "1 cup unsalted butter, softened\n3/4 cup granulated sugar\n1 large egg\n2 tablespoons orange zest (from 2 medium oranges)\n2 tablespoons fresh orange juice\n1 teaspoon vanilla extract\n2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour\n1/2 teaspoon baking powder\n1/4 teaspoon salt\n1/2 cup pitted green olives, finely chopped (Castelvetrano preferred)\n2 tablespoons coarse sugar, for topping (optional)",
    "method": "Step 1: In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter and granulated sugar until light and fluffy, about 3-4 minutes. Really take your time here, mate – properly creamed butter and sugar creates that lovely tender crumb we're after.\n\nStep 2: Add the egg, orange zest, orange juice, and vanilla extract to the butter mixture. Beat until well combined, scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed. The mixture might look slightly curdled at this point – don't worry, that's perfectly normal!\n\nStep 3: In a separate bowl, whisk together the all-purpose flour, baking powder, and salt until evenly combined. Gradually add this dry mixture to the wet ingredients, mixing on low speed just until a soft dough forms. Be careful not to overmix – we want these cookies to stay tender.\n\nStep 4: Drain your olives thoroughly and pat them dry with paper towels to remove excess moisture. Finely chop them into small pieces – you want little bursts of flavor, not large chunks. Gently fold the chopped olives into the cookie dough until evenly distributed.\n\nStep 5: Cover the dough with plastic wrap, pressing it directly onto the surface of the dough, and refrigerate for at least 1 hour, or up to overnight. This chilling step is crucial – it firms up the butter and allows the flavors to meld beautifully.\n\nStep 6: When ready to bake, preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line two baking sheets with parchment paper. Remove the chilled dough from the refrigerator and let it sit at room temperature for about 10 minutes to make it easier to handle.\n\nStep 7: Using a tablespoon or small cookie scoop, portion the dough into 1-inch balls and place them about 2 inches apart on the prepared baking sheets. Slightly flatten each ball with the palm of your hand or the bottom of a glass dipped in granulated sugar to prevent sticking.\n\nStep 8: If using, sprinkle the tops of the cookies with coarse sugar for a bit of sparkle and crunch. This creates a lovely contrast with the savory olives.\n\nStep 9: Bake in the preheated oven for 12-15 minutes, or until the edges are just turning golden brown while the centers remain soft. You don't want to overbake these beauties – they should be lightly golden around the edges but still tender in the middle.\n\nStep 10: Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheets for 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. The cookies will firm up as they cool but maintain a wonderful tender texture. Store in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 5 days, though I doubt they'll last that long!",

    "method": "Step 1: Start by preparing your saffron infusion. In a small bowl, crush the saffron threads between your fingers to release their oils and aroma. Pour the warm milk over the crushed threads, stir gently, and let sit for at least 10 minutes until the milk turns a beautiful golden-yellow color and is richly fragrant.\n\nStep 2: While the saffron infuses, wash your oranges thoroughly and zest them using a microplane or fine grater, being careful to only get the orange part and not the bitter white pith. Then juice one of the oranges to get 2 tablespoons of fresh juice. Set both aside.\n\nStep 3: In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, and salt until well combined. This ensures your dry ingredients are evenly distributed throughout the dough.\n\nStep 4: In a large bowl or the bowl of your stand mixer, cream together the softened butter and sugar on medium speed for about 3 minutes until light and fluffy. Don't rush this step – proper creaming incorporates air into the mixture for a tender cookie texture.\n\nStep 5: Add the egg to the butter mixture and beat until fully incorporated, about 1 minute. Scrape down the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula to ensure everything is mixed evenly.\n\nStep 6: Pour in the vanilla extract, orange juice, orange zest, and the saffron-infused milk (including the saffron threads). Mix on low speed until just combined, about 30 seconds. The mixture might look slightly curdled, but don't worry – that's normal!\n\nStep 7: Gradually add the flour mixture to the wet ingredients, mixing on low speed just until no dry flour remains. Be careful not to overmix, as this can make your cookies tough. The dough will be soft and slightly sticky.\n\nStep 8: Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate the dough for at least 1 hour or up to overnight.

Gently flatten each ball slightly with the bottom of a glass or your palm.\n\nStep 12: Bake in the preheated oven for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are just beginning to turn golden but the centers still look slightly soft. Don't overbake – they'll continue cooking on the hot baking sheet.\n\nStep 13: Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheets for 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. As they cool, they'll firm up and develop that perfect tender texture with crisp edges.\n\nStep 14: Store in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 5 days, or freeze for up to 3 months.

    "method": "Step 1: In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, and salt until well combined. Set aside while you prepare the wet ingredients. Step 2: In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar using an electric mixer on medium speed for about 3 minutes, until the mixture becomes light and fluffy. Scrape down the sides of the bowl as needed. Step 3: Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition until fully incorporated. Mix in the vanilla extract and almond extract (if using), beating for another 30 seconds until smooth. Step 4: Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet mixture, mixing on low speed just until combined. Be careful not to overmix or your cookies will become tough. Step 5: Using a rubber spatula, gently fold in the cold cream cheese cubes and white chocolate chips, being careful not to overmix so the cream cheese stays in distinct pieces. This creates those lovely cheesecake pockets in your finished cookies. Step 6: Very gently fold in the raspberries, taking care not to crush them. If using fresh raspberries, they should remain whole; if using thawed frozen raspberries, expect some color bleeding which will give your cookies a nice marbled effect. Step 7: Cover the dough with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 2 hours or overnight. This resting time is crucial to develop flavors and prevent the cookies from spreading too much during baking. Step 8: When ready to bake, preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line two baking sheets with parchment paper. Remove the dough from the refrigerator and let it sit at room temperature for about 10 minutes to soften slightly.

    "ingredients": "1/2 cup unsalted butter\n1/2 cup granulated sugar\n2 tablespoons heavy cream\n2 tablespoons honey\n1/2 cup all-purpose flour\n1/2 cup sliced almonds, lightly toasted\n1/4 cup finely chopped crystallized ginger\n1 teaspoon orange zest\n1/4 teaspoon salt\n8 ounces good quality dark chocolate (70% cocoa)\n1 teaspoon vegetable oil",
    "method": "Step 1: Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line two baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone mats. Make sure you've got plenty of space between trays as these cookies will spread significantly during baking. Step 2: In a medium saucepan over medium heat, combine the butter, sugar, cream, and honey. Stir constantly with a wooden spoon until the butter melts completely and the mixture comes to a gentle boil, about 3-4 minutes. Once bubbling, remove from heat immediately – timing is crucial here! Step 3: Add the flour, toasted sliced almonds, chopped crystallized ginger, orange zest, and salt to the hot mixture. Stir vigorously until everything is thoroughly combined and you have a sticky, thick batter. Let it cool for about 5 minutes until it's just warm and slightly thickened. Step 4: Using a teaspoon measure (not a heaping one, just level), drop small amounts of the mixture onto the prepared baking sheets, spacing them at least 3 inches apart. You'll want no more than 6 cookies per standard baking sheet – trust me, they'll spread out into thin, delicate discs! Step 5: Bake in the preheated oven for 8-10 minutes, or until the cookies turn a beautiful golden amber color around the edges. Keep a close eye on them after 7 minutes as they can go from perfect to burnt very quickly! The centers should still be slightly lighter than the edges. Step 6: Once baked, remove from the oven and let the cookies cool on the baking sheets for exactly 5 minutes – any less and they'll be too soft to move, any more and they might stick permanently! Then carefully transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely, using a thin metal spatula to lift them. Step 7: While the cookies cool, break the dark chocolate into small pieces and place in a heatproof bowl with the vegetable oil. Melt either over a double boiler (a bowl set over a pan of barely simmering water, ensuring the bottom doesn't touch the water) or in the microwave in 20-second bursts, stirring between each burst until smooth and glossy. Step 8: Once the cookies are completely cool, turn them upside down on a clean sheet of parchment paper. Using a small offset spatula or the back of a spoon, spread a thin layer of melted chocolate on the flat underside of each cookie. For a decorative finish, drag the tines of a fork through the chocolate to create a wave pattern before it sets. Step 9: Allow the chocolate to set at room temperature for about 1 hour, or place in the refrigerator for 15 minutes until firm. Store your finished florentines in an airtight container between sheets of parchment paper at room temperature for up to 5 days, though they're at their crispy best within the first 2 days.",
    "faqs": "<h3 id=\"\">What ingredients are used in Rich Chocolate Florentines with Ginger and Almond Recipe?</h3><p id=\"\">These luxurious Florentines include butter, sugar, cream, honey, flour, toasted sliced almonds, crystallised ginger, orange zest, salt, dark chocolate (70% cocoa), and vegetable oil. The combination creates the perfect balance of caramelised sweetness with warming ginger notes.</p><h3 id=\"\">How to bake Rich Chocolate Florentines with Ginger and Almond Recipe at home?</h3><p id=\"\">Learn how to bake Rich Chocolate Florentines with Ginger and Almond by heating a butter-sugar-honey-cream mixture, stirring in flour, almonds and ginger, then dropping teaspoons of batter onto lined baking sheets. Bake at 175°C for 8-10 minutes until golden, cool slightly, then coat the undersides with melted dark chocolate. Create decorative waves with a fork before setting.</p><h3 id=\"\">Why do my Florentine cookies spread too much during baking?</h3><p id=\"\">Excessive spreading usually occurs if the batter is too warm when dropped onto the tray or if you've used too much butter. Ensure your batter cools slightly before portioning, measure ingredients precisely, and maintain generous spacing (at least 3 inches apart) on the baking sheet.</p><h3 id=\"\">What's the difference between Florentines and lace cookies?</h3><p id=\"\">Florentines are a type of lace cookie, but they specifically include nuts (traditionally almonds) and are often coated with chocolate. The lacey appearance in both comes from the sugar mixture spreading and creating holes as it bakes, but Florentines tend to be slightly sturdier and more decadent.</p><h3 id=\"\">Can I substitute the crystallised ginger in these Florentine cookies?</h3><p id=\"\">Yes, you can replace crystallised ginger with dried cranberries, chopped dried apricots, or candied orange peel for different flavour profiles. For a more traditional Florentine, you could simply increase the amount of almonds or add other nuts like pistachios or hazelnuts instead.</p>",

    "calories": "120",
    "ingredients": "2 cups all-purpose flour\n1/2 teaspoon baking soda\n1/2 teaspoon salt\n3/4 cup unsalted butter, softened\n1 cup granulated sugar\n1 large egg\n1 teaspoon vanilla extract\n2 cups pitted dates, chopped (about 10 oz)\n3/4 cup water\n1/2 cup brown sugar, packed\n1/2 cup chopped walnuts or pecans (optional)\n1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon",
    "method": "Step 1: Start by making your date filling. In a medium saucepan, combine the chopped dates, water, and brown sugar. Bring the mixture to a simmer over medium heat, stirring frequently to prevent sticking. Cook for about 5-7 minutes until the dates break down and the mixture thickens to a spreadable paste. You'll know it's ready when it pulls away from the sides of the pan slightly.\n\nStep 2: Remove the date mixture from heat and stir in the chopped nuts (if using) and cinnamon. Transfer to a bowl and allow to cool completely - this is crucial, as hot filling will melt your cookie dough. The filling can be made a day ahead and refrigerated if you'd like to split up the work.\n\nStep 3: For the cookie dough, whisk together the flour, baking soda, and salt in a medium bowl and set aside. This pre-mixing ensures even distribution of the leavening agents throughout your dough.\n\nStep 4: In a large bowl, cream the softened butter and granulated sugar together using an electric mixer on medium speed for 3-4 minutes until light and fluffy. Don't rush this step - proper creaming incorporates air into the dough for the perfect texture.\n\nStep 5: Add the egg and vanilla extract to the butter mixture and beat until fully incorporated, scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed.\n\nStep 6: Gradually add the flour mixture to the butter mixture, mixing on low speed just until combined. Over-mixing will develop the gluten and make your cookies tough, so stop as soon as no dry flour remains.\n\nStep 7: Divide the dough in half and form each portion into a disk. Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour or until firm enough to roll. Chilled dough is much easier to work with and prevents spreading.\n\nStep 8: Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C) and line baking sheets with parchment paper.\n\nStep 9: On a lightly floured surface, roll one disk of dough into a rectangle approximately 1/8-inch thick and about 12 inches by 10 inches. Work quickly to keep the dough cold.\n\nStep 10: Spread half of the cooled date filling evenly over the dough, leaving a 1/2-inch border along one long edge. The border will help seal your roll.\n\nStep 11: Starting with the long edge that has filling all the way to the edge, carefully roll the dough into a tight log, like a jelly roll. Seal the edge by gently pressing. If the dough becomes too soft at any point, pop it in the freezer for 5 minutes to firm up.\n\nStep 12: Repeat the rolling and filling process with the second disk of dough and remaining filling.\n\nStep 13: Wrap the logs in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes or until firm enough to slice cleanly. This prevents your cookies from losing their shape when cut.\n\nStep 14: Once chilled, use a sharp knife to slice the logs into 1/2-inch thick rounds. Place the slices about 2 inches apart on the prepared baking sheets.\n\nStep 15: Bake for 10-12 minutes, until the edges are just turning golden brown. Don't overbake; the cookies should remain somewhat soft in the center.\n\nStep 16: Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheets for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely. As they cool, the cookies will firm up while maintaining their delightful texture contrast between the tender cookie and chewy date filling.",

    "method": "Step 1: Start by preparing your ingredients. Make sure your butter is properly softened - it should yield to gentle pressure but still hold its shape, not be melted or greasy. Finely chop the fresh rosemary leaves, discarding the woody stems. The rosemary should be very fine so it distributes evenly throughout the dough without any large pieces. Dice the dried apricots into small pieces about 1/4 inch in size. Step 2: In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter and confectioners' sugar using an electric mixer on medium speed for about 3 minutes, until the mixture is light, fluffy and pale in color. Don't rush this step - proper creaming creates the perfect shortbread texture. Step 3: Add the vanilla extract to the butter mixture and beat for another 30 seconds until fully incorporated. The vanilla helps balance the herbal notes of the rosemary. Step 4: In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour and salt. Gradually add this dry mixture to the creamed butter, mixing on low speed just until combined. The dough will look somewhat crumbly but should hold together when pressed between your fingers. Be careful not to overmix or the cookies will become tough. Step 5: Using a wooden spoon or spatula, gently fold in the chopped rosemary and diced apricots until evenly distributed throughout the dough. The warmth of your hands will help bring the dough together if it seems too crumbly. Step 6: Divide the dough in half and shape each portion into a log about 2 inches in diameter. Wrap each log tightly in cling film or parchment paper and refrigerate for at least 1 hour, or up to 3 days. This chilling time is crucial as it allows the flavors to meld and makes the dough easier to slice. Step 7: When ready to bake, preheat your oven to 325°F (165°C) and line two baking sheets with parchment paper. Remove one dough log from the refrigerator and let it sit at room temperature for about 5 minutes to soften slightly. Step 8: Using a sharp knife, cut the log into 1/4-inch thick rounds. If the dough crumbles a bit while cutting, simply press it back together. Place the rounds about 1 inch apart on the prepared baking sheets, then sprinkle each cookie lightly with demerara sugar for a subtle crunch and sparkle. Step 9: Bake in the preheated oven for 22-25 minutes, until the edges are just barely turning golden. Don't overbake - the cookies should not brown significantly. They'll still be somewhat soft when you remove them from the oven but will firm up as they cool. Step 10: Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheets for 5 minutes before carefully transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Repeat the process with the remaining dough log. These shortbread cookies will keep in an airtight container at room temperature for up to a week, and the flavor actually improves after a day as the rosemary notes develop.",

This ensures your dry ingredients are evenly distributed throughout the dough later on.\n\nStep 3: Now for the wet ingredients. In a large bowl, beat the softened butter and sugar together using an electric mixer on medium speed for about 3 minutes, or until the mixture becomes light and fluffy. You want to incorporate plenty of air here for a tender cookie, so don't rush this step, mate!\n\nStep 4: Add the egg to your butter mixture and beat until completely incorporated, about 1 minute. Then add the lime zest, lime juice, chopped rosemary, and vanilla extract. Mix until everything's beautifully combined, scraping down the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula to make sure nothing gets left behind.\n\nStep 5: Gradually add your dry ingredients to the wet mixture, about a third at a time, mixing on low speed just until combined after each addition. Be careful not to overmix – stop as soon as no dry flour is visible. The dough should be soft but not sticky.\n\nStep 6: Using a tablespoon or a small cookie scoop, portion out balls of dough (about 1 tablespoon each) and place them on your prepared baking sheets, leaving about 2 inches between each cookie to allow for spreading. Gently flatten each ball slightly with the palm of your hand.\n\nStep 7: Bake in your preheated oven for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are just beginning to turn golden but the centers still look slightly soft. Don't overbake these beauties! They'll continue cooking a bit on the hot baking sheet after you take them out.\n\nStep 8: Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheets for about 5 minutes – they're quite delicate when hot. Then transfer them to wire cooling racks to cool completely before glazing.\n\nStep 9: While the cookies are cooling, prepare your lime glaze. In a small bowl, whisk together the powdered sugar, lime juice, and lime zest until smooth. If the glaze seems too thick, add a tiny bit more lime juice, a few drops at a time. If it's too thin, add a little more powdered sugar until you get the perfect drizzling consistency.\n\nStep 10: Once the cookies are completely cool, drizzle the lime glaze over them using a spoon or a fork. If desired, place a tiny rosemary leaf on top of each cookie while the glaze is still wet. Let the glaze set for about 30 minutes before serving or storing.

    "faqs": "<h3 class=\"faq\">What ingredients are used in Salted Caramel and Pretzel Chocolate Chip Cookies?</h3><p>These cookies require all-purpose flour, baking soda, salt, unsalted butter, granulated and brown sugars, eggs, vanilla, chocolate chips, pretzel pieces, soft caramel candies, and flaky sea salt for the perfect sweet-salty balance.</p><div class=\"faqsep\"></div>\n<h3 class=\"faq\">How to bake Salted Caramel and Pretzel Chocolate Chip Cookies at home?</h3><p>Learn how to bake Salted Caramel and Pretzel Chocolate Chip Cookies by preheating your oven to 350°F, mixing wet and dry ingredients separately before combining, then folding in chocolate chips, pretzels, and caramel pieces. Chill the dough, portion into balls, sprinkle with sea salt, and bake for 10-12 minutes until golden at the edges but slightly underdone in the centres.</p><div class=\"faqsep\"></div><h3 class=\"faq\">Why should I chill cookie dough before baking?</h3><p>Chilling cookie dough solidifies the butter, preventing excessive spreading during baking. It also allows flavours to meld together, intensifying the taste. For these sweet-salty cookies, 30 minutes is sufficient, but overnight chilling will produce even better results.</p><div class=\"faqsep\"></div><h3 class=\"faq\">How do you prevent caramel from sticking to the baking tray?</h3><p>Always use parchment paper when baking cookies with caramel to create a non-stick barrier. Allow cookies to cool for 5 minutes on the tray before transferring to a wire rack, giving the hot caramel time to set slightly and become less sticky.</p><div class=\"faqsep\"></div><h3 class=\"faq\">Can I use caramel sauce instead of caramel candies in cookies?</h3><p>Caramel sauce isn't recommended as a direct substitute for caramel candies in cookies as it's too thin and will spread excessively during baking. Instead, use soft caramel candies, caramel bits, or make caramel pockets by freezing small dollops of thick caramel sauce before adding to dough.<div class=\"faqsep\"></div>",

This quick and easy cookie recipe combines earthy matcha with sweet-tart flavors for a uniquely delicious treat. Perfect for afternoon tea or as a special homemade gift!",
    "prepTime": "20 mins",
    "cookTime": "12 mins",
    "servings": "18",
    "calories": "210",
    "ingredients": "2 cups all-purpose flour\n2 tablespoons matcha powder (culinary grade)\n1/2 teaspoon baking soda\n1/2 teaspoon salt\n3/4 cup unsalted butter, softened\n3/4 cup granulated sugar\n1/4 cup light brown sugar, packed\n1 large egg, room temperature\n1 teaspoon vanilla extract\n1 1/2 cups white chocolate chunks (or high-quality white chocolate bar, chopped)\n1 cup frozen raspberries (keep frozen until ready to use)",
    "method": "Step 1: Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line two baking sheets with parchment paper. This prevents your cookies from sticking and makes cleanup a breeze, trust me! Step 2: In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, matcha powder, baking soda, and salt until well combined. The matcha should be evenly distributed with no green clumps remaining – this'll give your cookies that lovely consistent color. Step 3: In a large bowl, cream together the softened butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar using an electric mixer on medium speed for about 3 minutes, until the mixture becomes light and fluffy. Don't rush this step – proper creaming is what gives these cookies their wonderful texture! Step 4: Add the egg and vanilla extract to the butter mixture and beat for another minute until completely incorporated and smooth. Scrape down the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula to make sure everything's mixed evenly. Step 5: Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing on low speed just until combined. Be careful not to overmix – stop as soon as the flour disappears to keep your cookies tender. Step 6: Gently fold in the white chocolate chunks using a spatula. Now quickly fold in the frozen raspberries, being careful not to crush them or overmix – about 4-5 folds should do it. The dough will become slightly pink in places where the raspberries start to thaw, but that's part of their charm! Step 7: Using a 2-tablespoon cookie scoop or spoon, drop rounded portions of dough onto the prepared baking sheets, spacing them about 2 inches apart. If you find the dough too sticky from the raspberries starting to thaw, pop it in the refrigerator for 10 minutes to firm up. Step 8: Bake in the preheated oven for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are just set but the centers still look slightly underdone. They'll continue cooking on the hot baking sheet after you take them out. For soft cookies, it's better to slightly underbake than overbake! Step 9: Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheets for 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. They'll be quite fragile while hot because of the melted chocolate and raspberry pockets, so handle with care. Step 10: Store cooled cookies in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days, or freeze for longer storage. If freezing, place parchment paper between layers to prevent sticking. Enjoy these beautiful treats with a cup of tea or coffee!",

    "ingredients": "1 cup unsalted butter\n1 cup granulated sugar\n1/2 cup light brown sugar, packed\n2 large eggs, room temperature\n2 teaspoons vanilla extract\n2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour\n1 teaspoon baking soda\n1/2 teaspoon salt\n1 1/2 cups high-quality white chocolate chips or chunks\n1 cup almonds, toasted and roughly chopped\n1/2 teaspoon flaky sea salt (optional, for sprinkling)",
    "method": "Step 1: Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line two baking sheets with parchment paper. This prevents sticking and makes cleanup a breeze. Step 2: If your almonds aren't already toasted, spread them on a baking sheet and toast in the preheated oven for 8-10 minutes until fragrant and lightly golden, tossing halfway through. Keep a close eye on them—they can burn quickly! Let them cool completely before roughly chopping. Step 3: In a medium saucepan over medium heat, melt the butter, swirling occasionally, until it turns amber and smells nutty, about 5-7 minutes. The butter will foam, then the foam will subside, and brown bits will form at the bottom. This browned butter adds an incredible depth of flavor to the cookies. Pour into a large heat-resistant bowl and let cool for 10 minutes. Step 4: Add both sugars to the cooled brown butter and beat with an electric mixer for 2 minutes until well combined. The mixture won't get as fluffy as with softened butter, but that's perfectly fine. Step 5: Beat in the eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Add the vanilla extract and mix until fully incorporated, scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed. Step 6: In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, and salt. Gradually add this dry mixture to the wet ingredients, mixing on low speed just until combined. Be careful not to overmix, which can make your cookies tough. Step 7: Gently fold in the white chocolate chips and toasted chopped almonds by hand using a rubber spatula until evenly distributed throughout the dough. Step 8: For the best flavor and texture, chill the dough for at least 30 minutes (or up to 24 hours if you have time). This allows the flavors to meld and prevents the cookies from spreading too much during baking. Step 9: Using a cookie scoop or tablespoon, portion the dough into balls about 1 1/2 tablespoons each, and place on the prepared baking sheets, leaving about 2 inches between each cookie to allow for spreading. Step 10: If using, sprinkle each dough ball with a few flakes of sea salt. This enhances all the flavors and creates a wonderful sweet-salty contrast. Step 11: Bake in the preheated oven for 10-12 minutes, until the edges are set and golden but the centers still look slightly underdone. They'll continue cooking as they cool. For even baking, rotate your pans halfway through the baking time. Step 12: Let the cookies cool on the baking sheets for 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. The white chocolate will be very hot right out of the oven, so give them time to set! Step 13: Store in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 5 days, if they last that long! You can also freeze the baked cookies for up to 3 months, or freeze portions of dough to bake fresh cookies whenever the craving strikes.",
